      <div class="grid-item" id="description1"><p>Who am I? I'm the greatest and cutest person you've ever met. I have a charismatic personality. I've accepted my very sad humour as a coping mechanism. And I love cooking and ESPECIALLY eating. If there's anyone I'd like to meet and be friends with, it'd be Obama for sure. I think I could out-hoop him.</p></div>

      <div class="grid-item" id="description2"><p>This is my family. They're alright - just like any other family - but just a tad cooler. They feed me until I strictly gain 20 pounds every time I come home. They believe in me even though they don't understand why I'm still in school. And they desperately hope I have a baby within the next two years with a very rich man.</p></div>
      <div class="grid-item" id="description1"><p>This is not my cat actually, but I love him nonetheless. His name is Fulano and he enjoys attacking me while sumultaneously cuddling me. So adorable he is *heart emoji* like a little lion.</p></div>
