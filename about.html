      <div class="grid-item" id="description1"><p>This is my favorite human in the whole wide world, my mom, Amrita (a human!!) and my best friend and cousin, Fulano the Cat. Fulano and I play every day! We wrestle and play tag. He lets me play with his toys sometimes and I let him play with mine. He thinks just because he's a week older that he can drink out of my doggy water bowl but I'll show him who's boss when I get big and strong!!</p></div>

      <div class="grid-item" id="description2"><p>This is my whole family. They're alright - just like any other family - but just a tad cooler. They feed me a lot and believe in me and always take me on walks and play with me. From left to right is me, my Dad - Alan, my Mom - Amrita, Aunty Ashley, and my cousin Fulano. I love all of them so much!</p></div>
      <div class="grid-item" id="description1"><p>I LOVE PLAYING OUTSIDE. It's my favorite place to be and my favorite thing to do. I love staring at different animals from far away. I love meeting new people and being petted. When I see another dog I get really exicted to meet a new friend. I like looking at the ducks and their families from far away too. And I love playing with the leaves. Fall is my favorite season thus far! I wish my cousin Fulano would play outside with me but he's a little scared. I told him he just needs time and sooner or later he'll be like those really big fat cats that I meet on my walks at night.</p></div>

      <div class="grid-item" id="description2"><p>This is my dad. He takes care of me every day and I really love him. He always says I have a lot of learning to do because I sometimes make accidents in the house, but he loves me anyway. He gives me treats when I learn a new trick and when I've basically been a good boy. During Thanksgiving, I got to meet my other aunts and uncles and even my grandparents! It was fun. My dad said they spoiled me. Miss them so much!</p></div>
